# Playground

In route to working on AnalysisWorkflows(aka Haapi, MrPhelps, whatever) we need to do some digging. What is AnalysisWorkflows? Well it's TBD. Think, dynamic verson controlled and live tuned DAGs of heterogeneous compute and hardware with intelligence baked in for Julia. Oh with an easy syntax, and, better then anything else ever. Realistically, something like one of the many workflow scheduler, monitor's out there. 

Anyways, I think starting out assuming we know the best way to tackle the problem could lead to some dead-ends, or unstable code. So I vote we first play a little. Let's find some nice patterns, functions, and workflows for our own workflow. Open up communication, get the community interested, and make a lot of stupid mistakes together. Okay hopefully not a lot, but you get the drift.

The main deliverables for this repository are the following:
1. Make friends
2. Tinker with Julia (1.3.1 only please - we gotta be bug hunters for JuliaLang)
  - Learn about Distributed.jl, ClusterManagers.jl, Dagger.jl, whatever you want.
3. A safe place to hack away and share code from, ask questions, etc.
4. Maybe some tutorials/documentation could spin out of this effort for the requisite JuliaLang packages?

## Note
If you want to join this repository let us know, or if you don't want to be a part of it anymore let us know. Also, if anyone is rude or breaking code of conduct, or something also let us know. This is an open source effort driven by the core values of JuliaLang, no exceptions.
